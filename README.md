## **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

The MVP of this application is to allow potential customers to choose whether or not they would like to purchase anything, see the day's specials, choose the amount of bread and/or pastry they would like, and see that in their detailed order information as well as the total of their order.

Stretch goals include:

* Allow potential customers to buy different kinds of Bread and Pastries.
* Add additional deals that fall on different days of the week.
* Allow potential customers to continue adding to their cart/order.
